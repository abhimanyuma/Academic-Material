Hai,
Here you will find all my academic material, while you are free to use the materials in anyway that you wish, I hope you will not use for blind copying for your assignments. 
The only parts that have been ommitted from the actual repo is certain copyrighted stuff which I am able to use (Include mainly research papers / books from various sources that I have downloaded under Institute Tie-up)

I have *not* included any styling sheets that you can find under texlive packages, in case any styling sheet gives an error please update texlive to include it
