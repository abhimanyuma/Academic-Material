Introduction
============

In this course we will learn functional programming through
haskell. The main motivation of this course is to prepare people for
real world programming. To be a successful haskell programmer, I
believe, one needs the uncluttered thought of a mathematician combined
with the pragmatism of an Engineer. One can learn the basics in a
matter of days. However, one requires regular practice to be an
accomplished programmer.

What will be done in this course ?
----------------------------------

Covering the entire language, the mathematical background and the
libraries is impossible in a semester long course. So in the class we
will learn the basics of haskell and some of the mathematical
notions. In fact, most of the class will be devoted to understanding
these mathematical concepts. Programming in haskell is a good exercise
to your mathematical muscle and thus this is an important component of
this course. But I hope this course does not end up being a collection
of [abstract nonsense]. Therefore, we will have regular (i.e. weekly)
*ungraded* assignments to pull us back to real world.

## Evaluation.

Your grade will depend on your performance in exams (which constitutes
70% of the marks) and in the semester long project (which takes up the
remaining 30% of marks). There will be zero credit for the weekly
assignments. However, they are what will help you build the knowledge.

Projects can be done in a group of *3 or less*. Beside the projects
have to be under version control and since it is expected to be in
haskell, should be released as a [cabal] package.  I recommend using
[darcs] as the version control program.  We will **NOT** discuss darcs
or cabal in the course, you will have to learn it on your own.  You
may choose on what you want to work on but I will put up a list of
sample projects for you to get an idea of the scope of haskell as an
application development framework.

Besides, I encourage you to use haskell in your other programming
needs like B.Tech project, M.Tech/Ph.D Thesis etc.
